It's taken me a while to start liking who I am and what I look like because of the many hurtful comments I got from the people who were supposed to be there for me.

I’d say a 6 or 7 out of 10 with a ton of potential. You could still tighten up the body a bit, and experiment with makeup a bit until you find a look that works for you daily. Coverup would be good and eye liner/eye shadow to darken your eyes a bit, I think that’d do a lot to sexify you. Lastly, you need a hairstyle that works for you. Your hair style in those pics doesn’t really make sense and is doing you no favors.

It’s a feeling on the inside but physically it’s the eyes and cheeks that make the difference. People think smiles are just about teeth but that’s just the lower half of the face, work on the top half. The pic with your friend is a genuine smile for reference, your eyes squint slightly with the raising of cheeks. I notice you have a low smile line which I’m guess why you’re trying to practice but it’s really nothing to worry about! When you genuinely smile your eyes are so cute!

This is coming from a straight dude who wishes he could look that effortlessly great. And the smile definitely leaves an impression too, keep at it my guy!\n",

Instead, do weight training with good healthy meals packs with plenty of proteins and good amount of carbs (everybody needs carbs) and your weight will increase. Not with fat, but with lean muscle. Many women like to focus on leg day, and core day, because it helps develop a tighter core, and leg day will give females a booty too, but don’t forget arm day too!

As far as my rating goes, I would say face: 8/10 body: 6.5/10, my personal preference is usually a girl that works out and is toned up though, if you were, I'd say a solid 8, that being said, someone who prefers a thicker gal, would probably rate you a 7.5 - 8 right now.  Also, you should have added a picture showing off your smile!  That's definitely a side of you people want to see.  Great job on defeating your demons btw, stay healthy and you'll be fine.  You've got nothing to worry about,  no deformities, symmetrical face, beautiful skin, pretty big eyes.

If you aren’t already, put something like Mederma or cocoa butter on it, or see if a dermatologist or plastics specialist has some suggestions if it really bothers you - will probably clear up even more with time (I’ve dealt with many myself). Hair isn’t my taste, but it’s not “ugly.” I don’t think you’re “fat” - I think a lot of black ladies carry their weight in their hips/thighs and it’s quite attractive - embrace it!

You want to counter balance that (mostly if you want to be taken more seriously) by having a more dynamic hairstyle. I’d recommend cutting your hair to a wavy Bob just above the shoulders.

      "As a 27yo woman, I would say you’re average at 5/10. But that’s okay! I think a few tweaks can really elevate your look. First, I would recommend whitening your teeth. They look a bit yellow in the pictures. Pick up some crest white strips and use them. Also, your hair looks thin and you’ve got a receding hairline. I would recommend splurging some $$ and going to a trendy nice barbershop in your area and seeing what they recommend. It might be best to go short all over. I would also recommend new glasses frames. Warby Parker is an easy, good way to start, as they have trendy frames and you can try on 5 pairs at a time. All of these are relatively quick changes that can give you a boost. Also, just be natural in your pictures. No need to pull a face every time. Just smile, act confident, and be ready for the next chapter of your life and whatever it brings.\n",

For some reason in these photos your first picture you look the best... you look the youngest, but the others make you look like you're in your 40s or 50s. I read why you're not doing anything about it, but honestly I don't like your reasoning of \"Well, if guys can look more attractive as they gray then why can't women?\" That's only true if it looks good on you. Just like graying hair on some women looks good and others it doesn't... there has to be a sense of balance between face, hair, and body. \n",

Am I saying that gray hair on you looks bad? No, but it doesn't make you look your age. I say do whatever makes you happy, but if I were single and I saw you I would look past you because you look nothing like your actual age. Again this is just all personal opinion here, but you're not unattractive the least bit, but you also are not bringing your best self to the table. I am sure there will be someone who really likes this look and will respond favorably to it (and now that i've read more comments I can see that some do), but at the end of the day do what you want to do... don't try to send a message with everything you do and this is just one aspect of physical looks that doesn't need to be made into a \"man vs. woman\" situation. \n",

Even passed just general attractiveness, do I seem nice? Do I look young for my age or old? I've struggled with my weight and I'm at my heaviest since a I kinda had some ED stuff going on in High School and I'm not sure if other people see me as overweight like I see myself. I feel like my large breasts make me look a lot larger than I am.  I tried to add both flattering and unflattering body shots. I have a hard time making friends even though I think I look approachable. But maybe yall will disagree. \n",

      "What I don't like about it are the capped sleeves - I don't understand why they cut shirts that way, putting a line right in the middle of the upper arm just draws attention to a place where most women have issues. I think in a tank or long-sleeved crop top with a more supportive bra, you'd look great.  r/ABraThatFits is a good resource if you're struggling to find something to support you well (It is so hard to find a good bra, but once you do it's life-changing). \n",

      "The pants look a little too tight. The crop top however, isn't bad. Despite you being a bit heavier, your weight looks like it's distributed pretty evenly.

      "The high-waisted jeans say you're trying to hide your tummy, but the crop top says you want to show off. It just doesn't make a whole lot of sense, setting aside the issue of whether these types of outfits suit people who aren't extremely thin. It shows too much skin for the modest look and not enough for a racy look. The crop top makes you look very top-heavy, since you're big-breasted; this could be good or bad, depending on where you want to focus onlookers' attention. All that being said, it's not a judgment on your appearance as a whole. You're thicc and have a beautiful face. \n",

      "1.) You look a bit overweight ( or you have high % fat) and you can see it a lot in your face. It also looks like most of your fat is concentrated in your stomach. I think working out and toning out your body will help you immensely.\n",

      "You have amazing skin!! And a pretty smile :) if anything I would suggest maybe using a little bit of brow filler to darken up your eyebrows, especially with the glasses, for a more dramatic look. Also you can always try maybe a brown eyeliner and brown mascara for a little touch if you want. As for clothing, the shorts don’t look like they fit you right. Seems like you have a great figure, so I suggest highlighting that more! Higher waisted jeans and shorts, maybe with a looser blouse front tucked. Or fitted top tucked in. If you’re wearing a baggy puffy jacket, try neutral, more fitted clothes for underneath. Also for hair, you could always try wispy bangs, maybe shoulder length? Honestly up to you! You’re 19, so you’re in the perfect age to just experiment with what makes you feel good and confident. That’s all that matters! Ignore any haters out there.\n",
      "Bro i have similar eyebrows and filling them in will do wonders. Just a light pencil to your brow shape- it might feel weird at first but once you get used to it you’ll feel great. Also dresses would fit ur body type so find some casual ones + contacts maybe\n",

      "The masculine ratings are because you have stronger facial features (lots of attractive women do too, don’t worry) AND a hairstyle that looks very much like when a guy just grows out his hair (it’s usually very unstyled and flat) or a trans woman early in transition (often times they grow their hair out for a while before getting a style which results in flat, long hair in the meantime, usually on the thinner side because male hormones often thin the hair a bit). It’s flat, kind of thin and not styled up at - no bangs, no fringe, no cut. The middle part is a big no. Middle parts only work if the roots are bumped up and there’s more volume in the hair via blowdrying/products. If you already go to a salon, you need to find a new stylist asap because they have no business cutting hair. It looks like someone just tied up your hair in a ponytail and took some scissors to do one big chop. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thick brows can work for certain faces but yours are slightly too bushy for your face. I would suggest getting a professional to style them and then maintain them from there. Don’t get them plucked into oblivion -  they just need a little love to give you a softer appearance.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, if you’re curious, the most masculine parts of your face are the eyes and nose. When I cover the middle and top parts of your face, I really don’t perceive a lot of masculinity. You have a strong nose and your eyes have no makeup on them. Without makeup they look pretty plain, according to modern beauty standards. incorporating makeup, better hair and more feminine clothes will work wonders. \n",
      "\n",
      "On the plus side, you’ve got pretty nice lips (a tinted lip gloss would really make them pop more!), great teeth and great bone structure around your cheekbones and chin. There are lots of people who prefer women with stronger features rather than dainty, ultra feminine features. I think you could use a little more balance in femininity to reach your peak attractiveness. It’s all changeable stuff and totally up to you. Don’t let the low ratings get you down.\n",
      "I don’t know if you’re looking for advice or anything, but I have just a few notes if you’re okay with that. The other comments summed up the whole masculine features thing, but if you want to be a bit more feminine, here are a few things that might help: \n",
      "\n",
      "1- style your hair. Try something wavy or bangs. It helps you look more feminine, one of the reasons being guys with long hair usually let it be just straight. Hell, try bangs that might work too. \n",
      "\n",
      "2- some light makeup and maybe some lipstick should help. \n",
      "\n",
      "3- try to be extra feminine with your clothing choices and follow the trends. It sucks but hey that’s the way it goes. \n",
      "\n",
      "4- try to smile with your teeth more in pictures, it helps a lot. \n",
      "\n",
      "5- proper sleep and some eye cream. It’ll help get rid of the bags under your eyes. On that same token, general skincare will help a lot too. r/skincareaddiction is usually a pretty good sub for advice. \n",
      "\n",
      "6- something with your eyebrows should help. Maybe thinner/less bushy and some eyebrow makeup goes a long way. \n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t know if this will all help, but if you want to look more feminine then I hope you take some of these pointers into consideration.\n",
      "5/10 but I see a lot of room for improvement you have a great foundation to work with, by no means even close to unattractive, but there are things you could do to improve. 👍\n",
      "Sorry half the people are calling you a guy. I think the key to improve your look is definitely your hair. You need volume maybe wavy or curly hair, and layers? But its up to you can even go to the salon and ask for suggestions.\n",
      "bottom left looks like boyinaband\n",
      "Pretty! I think a haircut that frames your face would be ideal though 😊\n",
      "Love your eyes eyebrows and lips so much. You are very cute. This sub strives for a more feminine look so is def your clothing style that gets a low rating and maybe the absence of any makeup. 5.5-6 and maybe more with a different style ( this sub has different rules and guidelines I would rate higher in the other rate me sub)\n",
      "3.5/10\n",
      "I (18M) would suggest looking into potentially editing your hairstyle. You have a very nice hair color, but how you have it styled at the second makes it look like you have a very large forehead. \n",
      "\n",
      "The picture in the top right is the best one of these four imo, and mostly because your hair isn’t appearing as straight as in all the others. \n",

You beard is wonderful at that length but remember to use beard oils to keep it looking healthy!! The beard will also help your face look more full too :)\n",

So don't think too poorly about that :) Tall guys are extremely overrated and in my opinion the height can be a hassle. You've got a really cool and laid back style, you look like a California guy.

People on here might tell you to shave it, but not everyone understands that the mustache is very “in” rn in certain circles like I’d imagine it is at ur arts college and so they have different associations with it. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think that it’s mostly when you add the hair on top of the mustache that you veer towards a more slimy/shady as in “I’m can’t be sure this guy isn’t a con man” type of look. What’s bugging me about your hair is that it looks like you’ve grown it out from having it short and not gotten a proper hair cut in a while. Like, the different lengths between all the layers were cut to flatter short hair...but the way that your hair falls changes as you grow it out and so the layers of it are giving it kinda a wonky shape as is and making it look thinner than it actually is. I’d recommend getting the layers cut out of it and having it all one length. It’ll be a bit shorter (still long tho) at first, but it will look nicer as you grow it out. Don’t get a friend to do it either...seriously there are plenty of affordable places to get ur hair cut let a professional do it. That and keep it clean...you’ll not need much conditioner really...if you use it at all, just do it on the very ends of your hair and not all the up to the roots. Straight hair tends to moisture itself pretty well on it’s own and (I guess I’m assuming you go to SCAD given ur T-shirt) if you live in the south the humidity will also help. Might not need conditioner at all actually...experiment with it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Otherwise I think ur good though. You’re plenty cute. Again I’ll assume you’re at art school, but another thing about that too is that I’d imagine you’re surrounded by a lot of people with a highly curated ‘aesthetic’....pulling together ur look could go a long way. Just thinking about things like...just because I like both this shirt and these pants, does that mean they go together? What about the shoes and the hat? You don’t have to go insane with it or go out and buy a bunch of new things...just start thinking about how your present yourself as a cohesive whole.\n",
      "The top knot looks really good on you, and don't take any points off for height. There are plenty of guys/girls out there who like that in a man. I'm 5'9\" so I understand the negative aspect of being \"short\".\n",
      "I'll be honest, because you're asking for that. I find you less attractive than average. You have a large yet long face shape on top of a too slim body. Also a quite prominent nose and chin. The brows and symmetry are good. The whole clothing and hair style are not my thing but could look through that. 4/10\n",

She gave you pictures to rate..... this is probably what she felt most comfortable posting. She’s not asking if she is fat or skinny she’s just saying like hey am I pretty? And if it’s really that big of a deal where you feel like you can’t rate because your offended and feel she won’t reveal to you how much she weighs. Then just don’t fucking rate it jeez. She probably already knows that weight is an issue (most people who are overweight know they are overweight) so in reality, she doesn’t need your opinion on that. Which is a very logical reason to posts pictures of her face. The mentality was probably “Okay, I know I can work on my weight but what about my face?” That’s all. Anyways, you’re beautiful.

Sort of.IF she's looking for someone to date, she sees someone who probably thinks he's good looking and might not be a whole lot of fun - I'm assassinating you here, but the two pics where you're looking at the camera, you look bored. The other two are all about your jawline. Nothing here says \"hey, I laugh. I have fun. I'm going to bring you happiness, and fun\". They're ALL solo shots (does he have friends?) and you're not even smiling in any of them.\n",

Sure, but understand most girls probably want:- someone who's going to be dependable/solid/safe- then fun- then interesting- and who they can swoon over. If he's good enough looking that their girlfriends are excited for her, excellent. If he's so good looking they're going to have a crack themselves...not so good. But that's like 5% of guys. You KNOW if you're in that category.\n",

      "Feature | Rating | Explanation\n",
      "-------|------|-----------\n",
      "Eyes+eyebrows | 6.5 | Your eyes look good. I like the color (if bottom left has your true eyecolor and not contact lenses), the shape and the orientation. Your eyebrows don't look so good, however. They are a bit too close to eachother, and the shape seems too constructed, if you know what I mean. It looks a bit unnatural. Your eyes don't look crossed to me.\n",
      "Smile+mouth | 6.5 | Your lips are on the fuller side, which is attractive. Your teeth look white and in okay shape. Your smile is a bit awkward, but still sweet. Your smile in the bottom right pic looks best.\n",
      "Face shape | 8.0 | You have an angular face. This is a good thing in your case, because this gives you large cheekbones. I would say that most people would want to have cheekbones like yours. Your forehead is not too big, it's normal sized. Your chin looks fine to me, and your jawline looks really good. Your nose looks very wide, however, and I'm not a fan of it. Your face shape gets an 8.0 but your nose gets a 5.0.  \n",
      "Skin | not good | Yeah, you have quite some acne on your face. /r/SkincareAddiction might help you with that. This should, in theory, be fixable.\n",
      "Hair | 6.5 | Your hair looks pretty normal. It does look very oily in the middle right pic though. In the bottom left pic it looks good. The colors work fine for you.\n",
      "Body | 6.5 | I can't really see the outlines of your body but it looks like you're thin in a somewhat healthy way. \n",
      "\n",
      "You're about a 6.5-7.0/10 with your cheekbones as your best feature. You can improve this rating by fixing your eyebrows, cleaning up your skin, and perhaps doing something different with your hair.\n",
      "6.5/10 You have a really cute smile but your style is kind of average. A different fit and you'd be a 7+ easy imo.\n",
      "You have a great smile you're not ugly, of I really had to put a number I'd say 5,5-6/10. I think you should visit r/SkincareAddiction if you don't know it you might find answer to your skin problems.\n",

      "You're *definitely* not ugly. You have great hair and good bone structure (and seemingly a decent body(?), though you aren't taking advantage of it with very flowy/baggy clothes), and an adorable smile. The lazy eye is definitely not a big deal, I'm sure it's more annoying to you for practical reasons than it would be to anyone looking at you.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're worried about your skin (I've seen WAY worse, fwiw), you can seek some advice over at /r/SkincareAddiction...  a good care routine will probably have your skin looking flawless or nearly so in the span of a few weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can probably tune up EVERYTHING pretty quickly with some attention to your makeup. Whatever flaws or unevenness you may have with your skin is not bad enough that it can't be concealed.

You definitely look better in photos you didn’t take yourself (which is very rare, and definitely a good sign) which suggests to me you just need to get better at taking selfies at a flattering angle to fairly represent how you look :) x\n",

      "Very beautiful face! Your body is quite slim, some curves (like a bigger booty) would fit great. Awesome hair btw! Would say 7/10\n",
      "Congrats on losing weight! I think you look quite good. You have some very good features (eyes, general facial proportions, freckles, your neck/collarbone area), and some suboptimal features (broad shoulders, less curvy). I'd say as you stand you're in the 6.5-7 range but have potential for much higher.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, body toning. Squats and similar exercises will help you gain some curves in that area, and really legs in general. Your upper body looks plenty toned, almost like you're a swimmer. Assuming you're not a swimmer, I'd give up on arm exercises for now as they are quite build already. Focus on thighs/glutes. You can't change body shape really, but you can bring out things that are lurking beneath the surface.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clothing, you're a bit small in the chest, so keeping away from very small patterns like in pics 2/4 would be helpful. Larger patterns are ok. I think clothing like in pics 1/3/5 work best since it leaves your collarbone area open but covers your shoulders. You seem to have a long torso, so dresses will probably work best for you, or else choose tops with a bit more drama near the bottom like the tie waist style stuff. Or you can also go with a really high waist leading to higher waist pants/skirt. Styles like that will go a long way in enhancing what is a decently good shape.\n",
      "\n",
      "Makeup I think could use a bit of work but I'm not an expert there. It looks like your skin can easily lead to flushing, but using some more color in your makeup could help there. Choosing pink colors will probably just make people think you're always flushed, so I might consider a color a bit outside that. I personally like freckles, so I don't recommend hiding them, but I feel yours could be enhanced by finding a coordinating color to enhance them. I'm not good enough with makeup to envision exactly what would work, I just think that a little change there would go a long way in turning you from a pretty face to a beautiful one.\n",

Flat hair has the effect of making the face two dimensional, and with you, the angles of your nose become more jarring.

      "6.5/10, possible 8 with not too much effort.\n",
      "Personally looking at these pictures I'd rate about 5/10 maybe lower but with definite room for improvement. With make up make sure it's balanced, with your bold lip for instance make sure you have mascara on your eyes. Try tan and a bronzer, and try different clothes that flatter your body more. Try growing out your hair, maybe plaiting it too. The glasses are very dark and you are very pale so trying a more neutral colour would definitely suit better. Still cute! Love the dimple pic. Grooming your eyebrows could help too\n",
      "6/10 but with lots of room for improvement that is very easy to implement\n",
      "\n",
      ". Here are some things that can be improved: A lot of these picture are hard to judge because you are not smiling or establishing a pose. Top and Bottom Right look the best because of this. I would stay away from strong or bright lipsticks as your face is a bit pale, which is perfectly fine, but pairs much better with a more natural lipstick color IMO. Top middle, top right, and bottom left have much better make up comparisons. The hair is definitely the one that is holding you back. Curly hair is a beast, it either helps or hurts your appearance, no inbetween. If you can straighten your hair, that might be something to experiment with, though its tough to say if that would be better, especially if you hair is naturally curly which would be quite difficult to pull off, and I don't think curly hair is just flat out bad for you. The better approach would be to develop a strong style with it, and keep it clean and cropped at the edges. Some of your hair styles are just a bit too chaotic and distract from your face too much.\n",

      "Here are some things that are working: Body looks great 8-9/10, maybe just work off 5 pounds at most but I wouldn't sweat it at all, you are a very healthy and thin weight. Skin looks great and you have a VERY good face structure that gives you a lot to work with. You also have a very lovely smile when you show it. The glasses are nice, but contacts look better on you. Your face (and body) as a whole is very balanced and looks good, so you should want to have as little as possible distracting from that. For example, if you took that top right picture, maybe swapped the shirt, slightly better lighting, and a hair makeover, and you would easily hit 9-10/10 honestly.\n",

You're really pretty, the makeup just enhances your beauty. 8.5/10 the only complaint I have makeup wise is that you're a bit heavy handed with the lips and the matte lipstick gives off a cakey look in the sun in that one pic in your car where you did the ombre lips. If you used concealer to get that lightness in the middle of your lips that could be why it looks off though because every other picture looks great. Your eyebrows and eyelashes are amazing btw. \n",

You have a great natural look, know how to use makeup without overdoing it, spot-on eyebrows, and have some excellent natural features (dimples, lips, eyes are amazing). I like that your nails are natural and well taken care of, and teeth and skin look great too. It shows you put in a lot of effort to maintain yourself in a real way rather than covering up. So while you are probably rated a bit under some girls that look \"hotter\", I feel you have the type of look that is worth investing in longer-term.

As I feel some guys on these Reddit posts rate girls who are at most a 7 a 9 or close to a 10 on average. I think it's either that some of these guys have never even seen a girl who is actually a 9 before or they are just thirsty. Anyways that's my honest rating I think you look cute.\n",

I would avoid tops like the one on the top left or the top middle pic even tho I would usually be for them because I think it's too much combined with the tattoos. I know you're probably going to look this and say \"fuck you\" which is normal but I would really try to work on looking classier based off the tattoos already taking away a bit.\n",

But anyways, can’t 100% tell from the single pic of your body but you look to be at a really nice weight! The perfect size of not too scrawny, but not enough fat to be called chubby even. Smooth skin and tummy looks really pleasing, especially with your lovely bronze skin tone! I love your choice of lipstick, not sure about the haircut, personally I’m not a fan but the texture of your hair might not leave much room for different styles so that’s completely understandable if that’s the case. I’d be curious to see how you look without your glasses as they look a bit old-fashioned. \n",

If so, I'd say to just let it out because there is nothing more attractive than a genuine smile. And if anyone isn't into a genuine smile then they can go someplace else. Do you really want to be scared to smile for the rest of your life? Let me answer that. The answer is no.  If you're not making a big smile in these photos for a different reason,  then ignore that.\n",

      "You're really cute, 7.5/10, I just don't know how I feel about the short hair. You make it work but I just prefer long hair I guess. And I also think the eyebrows look a little weird, no offense. But you do have a beautiful smile, thumbs up for not making a duck face :)\n",

      "Your skin looks 30+, especially the dark around your eyes. Your makeup is also making you look like you're trying to appear younger than you are. Definitely get rid of the blocky filled-in eyebrows and do a more natural fill using a thin pencil and short strokes to define the edges more naturally. After that use some light eyebrow powder using a brush (not a sponge tip) so your brows aren't too transparent. Right now you're brows are really blocky and look painted on.

A more natural blonde colour or brown hair, plus toned down makeup will make you look quite a few years younger imo. \n",

Everybody does it, no one gets away from it.  You look wonderful, beautiful, even sexy.  Your age won't change that.  It's all attitude.\n",
      "Not sure if you’re asking for advice but I think you’re combining trends from your 20s with modern. The heavy winged eye liner and thick falsies was a few seasons or years ago. It would help to tone that down. The hair color (all over bleach blonde) is  dated. When I see all over light blonde ash hair I think a person is in the 35-50 yo range. You don’t see that in the younger crowd but it was popular 10-15 years ago and in the 90s. You should try low lights or balayage if you want to update it. It would suit you! Your eyebrow color doesn’t match your eyebrow pencil color in this pic, couple be the lighting. Thick brows are in, but drawing thick obvious brows on your face is not and is a quick way to age yourself. \n",

I’m assuming in the top pics this is a “going out” look? You have really beautiful eyes and some eyeliner and mascara would do a lot for them. Your hair is super pretty, you also have really nice skin. That said, I’d argue your outfit in all of these pics is a little...frumpy. I don’t mean that in a bitchy way at all.

It helps you turn down people you aren't jiving with, without feeling like you're calling them not good enough, instead you're appreciating their qualities and recognizing they aren't for you. It also helps you figure out deal breakers. Pets? Kids? Extrovert? Academic? Atheist? Those are extremely general, remember, get specific. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing it does, and this has been huge for me, is this: Once you've found a relationship, and you've been together a few months, and problems start poking their head out, you might find greater peace in the problem solving, because you know this person you've found is what you're looking for, or close to it. They are worth patiently working things out with.\n",

Other than that, i would add thinner liner on the top lid, or no liner at all  because it makes your eye lid look smaller the way you do your liner now. Other than that you look fine!\n",

Afterwards I am using L'Oreal Amazing Elixer on tips to make them look less \"flight\" and often moose on the roots for more volume. Side split would be great.  Go to a good hairdresser and get a good cut, as you like to have your hair down try to wear to the side and brush when untidy.  Buying a straightening and straightening it every now and then will also give it a better texture, as quick frankly it looks a bit greasy and dry in the photos. \n",

Two main suggestions - lose a bit of weight to bring out your face shape a bit better, and work on your eyebrow shaping. Look up eyebrow diagrams - if you draw a line from your outer nose past your inner eye opening, the extension of that line is where your eyebrow should reach. This one simple thing is causing people to say your smile looks fake, or you have weird expressions. Also, don't over-taper the outside of them.\n",

Probably the lack of makeup. I'd recommend just mascara for a natural but more feminine look. Weight loss would likely improve you to a 6.5-7 in my opinion. Eyebrow reshaping to a 7.5. highest point of eyebrow should be mid eye. When I see eyebrows where the highest point is inner eye, I think they always look artificially surprised all the time.

For your face, a little bit of makeup would go a long way. You have tight lips so some color could bring them out a bit more. You could go to a spa to get your eyebrows shaped. Your eyes are a bit small so a tad of eyeliner and mascara would give them more of a feminine glow. Using hair product would give it more volume and bounce which would also help. Once you do that, I’d also opt for a different pair of glasses.\n",

As far as body goes you are an 8.8/10 and I cannot say enough good things about your body, remember to keep up with it because once you lose it, it's almost impossible to get back. Face you are at a 6.9/10, partially since you look a little \"young girlish\". Style you hair (you have a good body/facial structure for \"vintage\" hairstyles, look up cherrydollface on YouTube) and learn some subtly aggressive makeup techniques that will make you lips appear fuller and your eyes smokier but still highlight your natural eye color (think Emma stone from \"gangster squad\") and lastly invest in some nice wardrobe additions that make you appear classy and refined. You are pretty now, but with some effort you could be a real head turner.\n",

      "[EDIT]: To clarify, I'd rate your face a solid eight. You have the right bone structure to pull of wavy hair, work it to your advantage always. I'd rate your body a seven. There is nothing wrong with with your body, but your posture is a bit off. Posture is very important when talking about one's body because a slouch is going to look heavier than he/she actually is. \n",

      "My advice? Keep your hair the way it is, but consider changing you glasses frames in the near future. Stand up tall and with confidence. Don't worry too much about your teeth, unless you are unhappy with them.

      "Your body is very nice: a conventionally attractive silhouette in that your proportions (hip, bust, etc.) all seem in line with comes to mind when you think of \"womanly\" (although there is no side profile, so I'm assuming the breast:butt proportions are about on par). The downside of this is that you have no polarized appeal (eg personally I like a proportionally small waist with big hips and larger bust for an \"hourglass\" or \"cello\" silhouette), but the upside is that you will next to *never* be penalized by anyone for it.  Visible abdominal muscles also indicate that you are in shape. Someone else said to tone up with weights, but if you want to keep the \"softer\" (and I mean that in a positive way) appearance, then just keep doing what you're doing. Overall a big win.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your face is cute: no major flaws or shortcomings. Just not amazing. Might be the camera angles, but something just feels off that makes me say above average, in a, \"good but not great,\" way *shrug*. My instinct is that you could work on your makeup game a bit, because I don't see a difference besides the noticeable presence of mascara. I think it could push you to a \"great.\" Apologies if this one sounds too harsh.\n",

You look like a cute young girl, I really don't know that I can put a number to you, you look about 16 in these photos. But hey, getting braces now is better than just not getting them at all. Nice teeth really improve the looks of everyone, so you're doing yourself a huge favor. You won't have to wear them forever! \n",

Also, show off your tattoos as much as you can, because they make a huge difference in your attractiveness\n",

      "You have a round face and an undefined jawline . I would suggest some haircut that will draw attention away from it . You just need a higher cut with your current style to make face look longer like Faux hawk, quiff, pompadour. Also grew a beard if you can.\n",

      "Former teacher here. I think the top left and bottom right are the best and most work appropriate for teaching high school. The other two are fun, but they look too much like how students do their makeup and would be more appropriate for your weekends or going out with friends. At 22 and looking young naturally, it's good to have a bit of separation from what a student would wear and what you would wear as their teacher.

      "8.5/10, you're gorgeous honey. I dom't think your forehead is an issue and I love your hairstyle as it is. The ombre is kind of severe and needs to be toned because it's very yellow. Try a salon quality purple shampoo like once a week (leave it in for about 20 min) and it will fade to a much more natural blonde. For bleached hair yours looks very healthy which is great. You can really pull off winged eyeliner so keep doing that. Agree with others that your skin could be improved which would make you look amazing. I don't see any scars or spots which is good, maybe get a facial and then use a lot of moisturizer along with an exfoliant every week or so. r/skincareaddiction has great tips. Hope this helps! \n",
      "Work on that skin my dude and you’re solid. Everything else looks good! \n",

So don't let it tank your self esteem... Rather be happy because it means you can go out and find that better person for you. As far as rating you, you are a natural beauty. Maybe get those teeth out when you smile to brighten your face up even more, but you are absolutely a knockout. 8.5 every day of the week. So don't wait for guys to approach you...

      "\n",
      "I’d suggest stop posting so much. Judging by your post history, you’re extremely insecure. You might want to look into some therapy. It’s not good to obsess over your looks so much. You’re good looking enough to get a girlfriend. As a 5’2” guy who used to date women before coming out, trust me - women aren’t very extremely picky in regards to looks (the good ones, at least, who are mature). Being clean, being fun to be around and being confident goes a long way. If my short ass can generate interest, so can you. \n",

You need to work on your confidence and probably some other things. If you compare yourself a lot, get off social media and stop looking at model-tier attractive people on Instagram, etc. Being extremely insecure will send healthy-minded women running for the hills. By reeking of insecurity and posting your pictures online for ratings so much, you’re striking out before you start. Dig deep and channel some major inner growth. A haircut or better fashion sense is the least of your worries right now.\n",

Like others have suggested either try cutting shorter on top or just let it all grow out a couple more inches and get it cut more evenly. The volume on top is what's elongating right now.\n",

      "\n",
      "In fact, just based on a guy's way of taking selfies, I can tell if he's gay or straight without seeing anything else. But the gay way of taking selfies usually isn't attractive, unless the guy is a 10/10, which most of us aren't. \n",
      "\n",
      "The pics should be of you out having fun, doing social activities, with your friends and/or family in the pic with you (can censor their faces of course). Should be a straight-on pic, no weird angles or weird faces, just a smile. \n",
      "\n",
      "Granted, this can be difficult. I have no real life friends (barely any online), my family doesn't go out and have fun, so I can't even follow my own advice. (I've even offered to pay people to pretend to be my friends for dating site pics, but I guess $50 wasn't enough). \n",
      "\n",
      "That said, I've seen it work well for others. \n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly,... the glasses. I wouldn't say you need contacts, but maybe try different frames. I know they're very expensive though. But those big clunky thick rims aren't working well. \n",
      "\n",
      "Third, find better clothes. Again, I'm terrible with this too, but maybe someone else could help better. But that middle pic is painful due to the clothes looking like $2 items from a bargain bin. You can do better. \n",
      "\n",
      "Hope I helped somewhat. As I said, these are more immediate and easier than everyone on here shouting to lose weight or grow hair.\n",
      "Nothing new to add but just want to say good luck and hope you find something that helps with the depression\n",
      "4/10. I think once you make a change in your diet , like intermittent or water fasting , you will accomplish your goals without over doing yourself physically. Once you lose some weight I suggest upgrading your wardrobe and only wearing tee shirts inside the house. Collared shirts and clothes that fit you well and look nice will make a big difference. If you prefer glasses, maybe try a different frame. I think you have a lot of potential. I think you just have to realize you deserve to be your best self .\n",

If you're fine with your torso and aren't using the long shirts to disguise it, then I would just go with shorter, less slouchy tops. The loose cardigan flowy top thing only looks right if you're pairing with light colors, and similar textures. If you've got a solid black tank under it doesn't look good.\n",

Accutane is a miracle worker. Definitely recommend looking into it.\n",

      "Gonna be 100% honest here and give you MY personal opinion. You look great generally. Can't find any physical flaw. But I find this style really awkward. Again, what I'm about to say is just my opinion. I find that your face doesn't fit the style at all. You look too sweet and kind to play the goth bad girl. The pics in which you look normal are great. 4th and 6th pics (without the choker) are great. That last one though, with the goggles and the fishnet stockings and the pentagram phone case are a bit too much for me. That outfit is great for conventions and parties but as \"usual attire\" it looks kinda tryhard for attention. I just find the whole goth-choker-pentagram look a bit childish and off putting. But I'm sure there are people out there who like this style.   \n",

You can start incorporating cardio when you're much older because, yes, it is good for your heart. But lifting weights is a great habit to form and you're still so young that you will have great gains the next few years. 6'5'' is probably your max height, which is already amazing, but some guys even grow until they're 20-21. So if you're a 6'5''-6'7'' guy whose put on some muscle...you're absolutely unstoppable in life. Seriously, and honestly.\n",

You do look young, I think you should totally try growing out your hair it would suit you perfectly and make you look a bit older plus I defo think the best thing you could do to improve your look is get your eyebrows waxed or threaded, don’t go too thin - you could get HD brows so they are threaded and tinted and get a nice arch shape but ensure to keep them quite full! You really don’t need makeup you could just do the brow thing, wear mascara, lip gloss, a bit of concealer if needed and maybe some bronzer but don’t be too heavy handed. Also, you could use highlighter on your lovely cheekbones to accentuate them! Maybe try going to a Charlotte Tilbury counter if you have one in your country or watch some of her YouTube videos, her products are expensive and you don’t need them but I could see you in that kind of makeup style in terms of how she applies makeup if you chose to wear it but as I said you really don’t need it! \n",

Look at a stranger, think of a positive attribute they have whether it be beautiful hair, great physique, whatever it is, take that positive thought and turn it into a smile you direct to them.

Or perhaps you give an 'off' vibe - you do seem rather serious and perhaps not 'approachable' as a result. Last but imo most important thing - are you putting yourself out there i.e. joining social groups or gym classes where you would naturally meet men? Or get some of your friends to introduce you to guys - you don't have to date them but likelihood is they'll know other single men who would be a good fit\n",

      "Another poster addressed the confidence part which I agree with, so I'll give some feedback. Your hair is really long and has a bit of natural curl which is nice, I wish my hair were like that. The unwashed part (I read your captions) is a little bit noticeable, so try getting some dry shampoo and using it on the days you don't wash your hair (I like the Batiste brand). I can see the red/brown highlights, that's a nice color! You could consider getting a more layered haircut or a subtle blonde balayage/ombré too, but I think the red suits you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your skin isn't terrible but there's a bit of acne, I'd recommend checking out r/AsianBeauty and looking at the sidebar for skincare products! I started getting acne after puberty when I was 21, so getting into a good cleansing + toning + moisturizing routine did wonders. Also remember spf sunscreen every day! \n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of makeup, I wouldn't recommend eyeliner on your lower lashline, it makes you look kind of sad. I think your eyebrows turning downwards at the ends also makes you look upset, try grooming them to be straighter across. Keep the eyeliner to your upper lashline and try a liquid brand like Clio with a good primer like Urban Decay to make it stay. Foundation would help even out your skin tone, or BB cream if you're not used to the heaviness of foundation. Concealer would help with undereye circles and red spots too. I'd recommend doing your face + eyebrows (maybe lipstick) first and seeing how that looks, then adding eye makeup later because that's the hardest.  Try regular or tinted lip balm for your lips, they look a little dry. Your facial structure is pretty good and you have nice lips, so lots of potential!\n",

      "\n",
      "Overall, 6/10. \n",
      "I honestly think you're really cute, your nose's bridge isn't what many consider ideal but it's not ugly. I'm confident most of the clowns who mocked you did it for your hand defect. 7.5/10\n",
      "I'd say 7/10, with the fact that I really like Asian girls so most guys would probably rate you a bit lower but to me you're really cute :)\n",
      "And yes I read captions\n",
      "Not into Asian chicks but I'd say 6 or so, you look average and fine to me. My mate has a similar hand and it has always knocked his self confidence but he's older now and doesn't bother him much any more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, first of all, I did read the captions. \n",
      "You are not ugly, I think you need to find a look and makeup that works for you. None of your pics have a smile, but I think you'd have a lovely smile. Also, look into a new hair cut that frames your face better, and brows that are less curved-you look mildly surprised right now. I would consider a good foundation and concealer and some eye makeup to play up your assets. Also, are you a generally happy person? The way you write seems kind of monotone and reserved, if that's the case I'm not saying change who you are, but it may be the reason you're having difficulty with long term relationships as you mentioned. \n",

The grey hair grunge picture style is perfect for this, it also falls over a bit of your face to hide the edge more. Also, possibly letting your eyebrows grow in towards the center a bit more if you can could help if you're plucking them farther out like that.   \n",

Your hair has a lot of volume which makes you look like a model in a shampoo commercial. Your glasses balance your face very well. You have lips similar to kylie jenner's lips. That is extremely rare. Many women want their lips to look like yours and you have a curvaceous body.\n",

Your hairstyle is also not doing you any favors. I am not sure if you have a high hairline because that would explain why you want to wear bangs, but if you don't have a high hairline, then I would reconsider your hairstyle. \n",

Try incorporating some jeans with a nice dress shirt or good quality shirt in general, but please NO fedora when trying to look nice.

Could use a better haircut and you look kinda scrawny, so getting a little muscle on you would help. You're only 18, so never having dating isn't that big a deal right now. As a man, you have to be proactive about dating if you want to get dates though. So ask yourself if you're really putting in the effort and asking people out. You're on the shorter side which is less attractive to women (assuming you're only interested in women) and being dark skinned is unfortunately [not as appealing](https://theblog.okcupid.com/race-and-attraction-2009-2014-107dcbb4f060) to women either at least for black guys.

      "Also 20f here, I think you have pretty eyes and a nice face shape! My first impression is your face seems like look a little washed out color-wise. It's hard to notice your eyes and eyebrows very much. I get the impression you wear makeup but just not a lot, and that's fine! Maybe try a little more eyeliner/mascara though or give your eyebrows some more definition? It would give the overall look more depth, and since you have such pale skin I think you need some contrast between your skin with darker lashes, or maybe darker hair. Your blue eyes are nice though! I think people just aren't seeing them. I hope that all made some sense.. I also have blue eyes and just colored my hair a dark brown, it makes them stand out WAY more.\n",

You've singled out complexion and weight as issues you'd like to target and those, with the addition of hairstyle, are the obvious ones that jump out to me as low-hanging fruit.

Only one pic so not sure about style but judging a book by its cover I think that some wardrobe updates would be a major improvement. Try some new shirts and learn about what looks good or whatever.

Secondly I wish people were more open. Yes, I understand that people highly value their privacy, and image, and thus create several throwaways to compartmentalize different aspects of them. But, one of the reasons that I grew to love reddit was because people were so honest and frank about things that bothered them. I would love to see these modelesque girls posting on /r/TIFU and/or revealing insecurities (such as their tallness). It makes them more real, and it makes other redditors (especially other insecure redditors) feel comforted that these modelesque girls are not some image living some perfect life blessed by their aesthetics, but a person with loads of aspects (including the darker/taboo ones) and interests.\n",

You look carefree but not in a flighty way, just that you're comfortable with your life, which is itself attractive. I think you're doing well for yourself. Wouldn't really make any changes.\n",

      "Happy Birthday dude. My advice...lay off the drinking and hit the gym. You will look and feel better. It might thin out your face and eliminate those dark circles. Other than that grow the hair out and try some new styles and for sure grow the beard out. As long as you keep it trimmed. I feel like there is a good looking dude under some of the visible sadness and unhealthy look.\n",

      "Drink less, sleep better, grow out beard and hair for best look. Hard 3 not point out in the crowd for being ugly look but below average.\n",
      "The drinking is making you look 40. You'd look so much better sober\n",
      "Happy birthday!\n",

      "Stop drinking, get into shape, smile.\n",
      "Happy Birthday.\n",
      "Shave the beard or keep a stubble like in your top left, looks a lot cleaner on your face. Get a hair cut that suits your head shape, I’d also recommend cutting back on the drinking and whatever else is making you look like you’re 38. Try getting some more sun you’d look wayyyy better with a tan and try get in shape lose the chubby look, the testosterone boost will also make you look more attractive in the face. You should also go with a wardrobe overhaul, try on some collared shirts that fit you well. Atm mate you’re about a 3/10 but honestly with a few changes like I said before you could very easily be a 6-7/10, happy birthday dude\n",

      "Your hair color looks so unnatural to me (almost peroxide-y). I have seen people with that yellow of hair naturally but it's rare especially at your age. Your roots also look dark but I might be seeing it wrong so maybe it is natural, who knows? However, the point I want to make is: the yellow tinge in the hair is seriously clashing with your pinkish skin undertones.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's very little to no kind of femininity in your face. I really advise against bobs or short haircuts in general unless you've really got a very feminine face. The haircut in any case is very boring and plain - I would definitely recommend growing it out longer. I think you really need to start working on improving your skin or wearing makeup to improve the evenness of the skin. \n",
      "\n",
      "Next time, please include more pictures (read sidebar rules). I can't tell because there are no body shots but even from the head shot it looks like you might be carrying some weight. The glasses also are not working for you. To sum it up: I highly advise changing your hair color to something with more neutral tones because that color is clashing with your very flared/pink face, change the glasses, grow your hair out longer, fix your eyebrow colors, and work on improving your skin or wearing even makeup. Hope this helps.\n",

      "As others have said, haircut, style, and color are REALLY holding you back.  Experiment with dying it while you wait for it to grow out.  The one good thing about the color it is now is that it will be easy to DIY dye darker.  The box dyes from walgreens etc are not bad at all.  A medium brown will look good on you, especially with a little red in it (your skin has pink tones in it).  Auburn, chestnut, whatever, feel free to experiment a bit.  Also, waves or a little curl will go a long way for a short haircut.  A LONG way. /r/fancyfolicles \n",

One thing that helped me was to sleep on a clean pillowcase EVERY night and don't touch my skin except to wash it.  Also keep your hair clean and don't let shampoo run onto your face in the shower.\n",

      "You didn't give a body shot, but everyone can always benefit from exercise.  I watch my calories and do 25 pushups and 25 squats/day, and have been doing pullup \"negatives\" (check out /r/fitness) for about 6 months now, and can now do a pullup!  Dieting is hard, but the exercises are super, super easy changes to fit into your day.  Even with a little fat, bodies with muscle look MUCH better. Everyone has time to do pushups and squats, and they make tons of muscles in your legs and arms look loads better.  Now my arms are more defined and my ass and legs look awesome.

Grow them out into side bangs and then just let them continue growing. Try to get back to a more natural color. The black does not suit you. Try some deep conditioning/oil treatments, maybe get a gloss to help the color, don't over process it or use heat. Start eating cleanly and exercising. You could try yoga, biking, skating, walking/jogging/running, going to the gym, following along workout videos, doing sit ups/push ups/jumping jacks, etc. start small and just make it a routine. It's a lot of fun and feels really good and improves your mood and obviously improves your appearance. I think with better hair and health/weight, you'd be REALLY pretty.

Your bangs and haircut aren't that flattering. These particular glasses aren't that flattering. That can be fixed. Anything \"unflattering\" about you can be fixed, if you want.

That’s why they are gentleman, they don’t run up to every attractive girl they see.  Start looking around at the other people in the room and in your life.  You are 100% correct that your have set the standard high and rightfully so.  This could be from your first love or the fact you have kids.  You need a man that has certain set of standards, morals and ethics because he has to be of father material.  He needs to guide and advise your kids into adulthood.  This is no easy task and it’s not likely to come from someone who has been in the single scene their whole life.  Find someone in a similar situation as you.   Someone who has matured as a result of having kids and you will find happiness.  People who have kids know what I am talking about, you are a completely different person as a result of them.

When you first meet them, it's difficult to think about anything other than how hideous they are. 2 - unattractive: people you do not know would not say that you're average, but if you've known them a while, they probably think you're ok; the average person would hook up with you only while drunk. 3 - average: you aren't attractive, but you aren't terrible either; with a good personality, most 3s are datable. 4 - cute: there are many fours that are cute; also, some people fall into the four category because of a weird quirk, like a buttchin. 5 - absolutely attractive: no arguing this one, most of the attractive people you know would be 5s; a 5 will not really understand what rejection feels like. 6 - smokin': this is probably the most attractive you've ever had a conversation with; they are way out of your league. 7 - unattainable: you might know one seven, if you're lucky; they are the most attractive person you can imagine.

You are beautiful you just have a few features that stand out more.. Thus you are called a troll. Contouring with makeup can really help down play these exaggerated features and help bring out your pretty eyes. Eat healthier and exercise daily. This will help with all the comments on your weight. I'm not sure how tall you are but go to the Dr.'s and find out what your perfect weight should be for your height and age.. Then make it your goal to be at that weight. This will better yourself in so many ways! Most importantly love yourself and be confidant. Confidence is key! You gotta work it girl!! Good luck and chin up.

If you were to revert to a more natural hair color, then it would be great paired with the red lip. Together, it comes off really strong. Also, I'd suggest switching up your frames- the severe black across your ivory skin is harsh. For your eyebrows I recommend visiting a threading salon.

My CC is that you may want to try and put on a bit of weight, which I know is hard, but it may help overall to make you look a bit healthier and more energized. Other than that, stay hydrated and get good sleep in because you have a bit of eye luggage :P nothing that can't be helped and nothing that's really bad. \n",

Besides, if you're not a natural redhead then the upkeep is insane and it takes a lot of work and a lot of product to keep it looking healthy. \n",
      "\n",
      "You mention that you have very fine hair to begin with. If you want a little extra \"oomf\" then you should use shampoos and conditioners designed to enhance volume. Also, don't be afraid of using a thickening cream or spray. Everyone who has great hair uses product. Very few people just have great hair without doing anything or adding anything to it. Also, stop flat-ironing it. It's flat enough, you know? Try using a brush and a hairdryer to style your hair. Not only will it look more voluminous but it won't damage it as much. \n",
      "And regarding the way you dress, I haven't seen enough to accurately gauge your style but I have seen some poor choices in your photo album. I don't understand why you wouldn't cover up your tan lines. Maybe at some point in the 90's it would have been in vogue (at least in porn) but it's certainly not anymore.

Listen, when it comes to getting good makeup you're going to have to splurge a bit. Hell, the stuff goes on your face. I think anything you're applying to your face on a daily basis should be some high quality shit. Also, remember that makeup is there to enhance your already existing features. Some women can pull off dark eye makeup and some can't.  It comes down to how your features are shaped and come together. For you I would suggest gold and peach neutrals. This is considering your hair color presently. I think you should steer clear of blacks and greys. Though, it's hard to tell what colors you actually do use because you've messed with the contrast in so many of your photos. Also don't be afraid to shape your eyebrows. Maybe try using a powder or a pencil to enhance them. \n",

      "Your hair looks like it could use a little TLC. If you don't already, it's a good idea to only wish your hair twice a week, at most, to allow those natural oils to develop. It'll liven up your hair, and, if you do it long enough, should offer some strength and volume.\n",

I would also suggest growing out your fringe as it isn't doing anything for you but that's up to you. Next, head to a makeup store and pay for a makeover and buy the products they use on you. You don't need to go to a fancy salon just the help with the makeup and that's saving you money. Ditch the glasses and try and wear contacts.

I buy my glasses on Firmoo (I don't have a super strong prescription though, -3.5, so take this with a grain of salt) and have never had issues. Glasses with lenses cost about $30, so depending on where you are financially you could buy a few pairs and see how you feel in them.

Not that it needs to be long, but with your bangs pushed off your forehead, it almost makes it look like you have a receding hairline.

When you first meet them, it's difficult to think about anything other than how hideous they are. 2 - unattractive: people you do not know would not say that you're average; the average person would hook up with you only while drunk. 3 - average: majority of people are 3-4; you aren't attractive, but you aren't terrible either; with a good personality, most 3s are datable. 4 - cute: most 4s are 'cute', not necessarily beautiful, but adorable and definitely worth your time; no one would ever look down on you for dating a 4; in addition to the 'cutes' some people get demoted to the four category because of a weird feature, like a buttchin. 5 - absolutely attractive: no arguing this one, most of the attractive people you know would be 5s; a 5 will not really understand what rejection feels like. 6 - smokin': probably the most attractive you've ever had a conversation with; they are way out of your league; \"beautiful\" could be used to describe a 6. 7 - unattainable: you might know one seven, if you're lucky; they are the most attractive person you can imagine.

Also, I would suggest growing your hair long and wearing it down. Add some volume (curls/waves) to frame your jawline nicely too! Lastly, it might just be the lighting/angles of the photos, but your contour looks a little too dark and heavy. I know it's hard to contour as a pale girl,there aren't many options out there. Instead I would suggest using a light bronzer (I really like the lightest shade of physicians formula butter bronzer! Too faced has a really light bronzer too, but imo it's not as good). Use it where you would usually place your contour (lightly), and also apply some at the top of your forehead. Lipstick/lip liner would also be a good idea to make your lips pop! Just a couple suggestions, but honestly your makeup game is pretty damn good! Eyeshadow and brows are great!\n",

      "Other than that, maybe just work out a little more. Get more of a solid build into you.\n",
      "You could benefit from having the sides taken in a bit more on your hair but otherwise there's not a lot to criticise. I don't know if it was wet or whatever in the first pic but your hair looks a lot better in the other photos where there's some volume to it. I'd say you should probably look to diversify your wardrobe a bit from your large collection of tank tops since it's both very bland and kind of posey. You look like you're in good shape and that's definitely something you should be proud of, and should dress to show off, but don't be \"that guy\". Add some casual button-up shirts and a bit of colour and you'll see a lot of improvement. A properly rolled up sleeved shirt can display a good physique just as well as a vest, and you'll look even better for the fact it won't look as if you're trying too hard. \n",
      "\n",
      "Otherwise, the only other main criticism I have is that awful posey pout you're pulling in about half of the pics. The first, second and fourth pictures are the worst for this. Ditch the MySpace angles as well, it all just comes together to make you look very cocky, posey and vain, whereas a cheeky smile like in pic 5 helps make you look confident and attractive in a much less punchable way, and is just a much more natural and warm look for your face. Your best photos are the last 3 where the pics show off your natural charisma rather than a \"look at how great I look\" vibe. \n",

      "6/10. Fifth photo is killer, if it was only that photo I'd say 8 or 9. A cocky smile is ridiculously flattering, while you feel slightly insecure/young/feminine in the other photos (maybe the tank tops? not sure what it is). \n",

Your style is, as people have been saying, unique and it's going to make you appealing to only certain guys with a particular taste. In the bottom picture, the blonde one, I think you are prettiest and the most widely-appealing. The only thing I personally dislike is your eyebrows. They are absolutely beautiful in shape but they are quite clearly drawn/painted on and I can't actually see any hair in your eyebrows whatsoever, which is highly unappealing to me (as a girl). I like eyebrows to be all hair that gets darkened and shaped by pencil/powder, not consist solely of it. That's just my two cents on you! Regardless you're pretty!\n",

      "The first picture you posted showed up really small for me, so it's hard to make any judgments based on that one. Also, I would like to see pictures of your face more straight-on. Based on what you have here, though, I think you are average-looking. It's hard to judge your body based on that picture of you sitting down, but you certainly don't look overweight, so that's a plus. Do you wear makeup? It doesn't look like you are wearing any in those pictures. If not, I would suggest you start wearing it, because it will only enhance your features. I would also suggest changing your haircut. Wearing it with a center part and completely straight makes it look very harsh, and it does nothing to enhance your face. If you want to wear it straight, wear it with a side part, and try adding some volume to the roots--this can be done with blowdrying techniques and hair products, like dry shampoo. A different haircut could help, too--I'm not a hairstylist, so I don't know exactly what to suggest, but if you go to a salon the stylist can give you suggestions and show you how to style your hair for whatever cut you get. Is that your natural hair color? It looks black or very dark brown to me...I think you would look better with a more brunette shade--still dark brown, but not the variety that appears almost black.\n",

      "Albeit the quite biased and picture-by-picture based comments, you have quite the appeal that one would be flabbergasted by. Only under extremely stringent rating code would you receive lower than an 8. Off of a quick glance rating, you get an 8.75/10. Guys have an intrinsic nature that includes a genetically pre-programmed rating system in their inferior parietal cortex(allows the \"translation\" to occur). Based off of this first glance, you are an 8.75/10 because of your position, look, skin color, face, and general outline. However, under an extremely stringent and controlled rating in order to keep the equilibrium of pretty people in the universe at a limit. As a note, consider the human girl population as a finite number. The girls in the population are split according to rating. We must exclude the rating of 2/10, otherwise we must delve into the topic of quantum theory where other dimensional beings can truly be uglier than our dimension, so we'll ignore any rating 2 or under. Starting from 3, we can make a graph of the finite amount of plotted points. p[this graph has the x-axis as the rating starting from 3, and the y-axis as the total number of girl at that exact rating. As the rating 3<n<10 increases, the total number of girls in the rating n+k decreases(k is (1/infinite)>0). This being said, the curve of the graph will decrease and decrease slowly. So we can write it as so: the limit as n-> infinity of f(rating) {n< 3} will equal 10. Hence it is possible for a girl to attain a rating of 9.99999, but never 10, because 10 would represent perfection. As for there being less girls, just imagine the graph of the curve as 1/x^2. If there was ever an imbalance in the total number of girls (i.e. too little low ratings, or too many high ratings), then there would be a dimensional rift that would split open the universe, and based off of all conventional physics, this should not be possible at all, as nature will kill off the surplus of n-rated girls, or add to a shortage of n-rated girls.\n",

      "6.5-7/10. I think you're definitely on the right track. I personally think if you're going for a look regarding the right picture, red lipstick may not be your go to, but of course some people can pull it off well with enough practice! ( it just isn't good to start off with from my experience ) Also blue eyeshadow is pretty tricky for anybody to pull off, unless you've got a bit of practice or the face for it. ( I sadly don't ) I think something that may help would be to try some more neutral brown to black eyeshadow palettes, maybe tone down the red lipstick just a tad. Let your hair grow out and research ways to style it, trust me it'll be worth it, and it can be lots of fun!\n",

I prefer a lean, slightly muscular build with wide shoulders- nothing too bulky. Kinda like a swimmer. To me, guys that lift too much are kind of a turn-off.

If that's not your style just do a bit of research on something else :) Working out to add a bit of definition to your body and arms would really help too, even if you don't want to bulk, your clothes will fit better and overall you will look much more attractive.

      "Idk about that. If you're ugly, you're getting a 4 and below. 5 is very bad too. 6 is alright. 7 is date range. 8 is hot. 9 is hot/beautiful. 10 is drop dead gorgeous or no issues. \n",
      "I don't like the guys on here because they rate beautiful girls really low . If a girl who is a 9 gets a 7, what is a 9 to you? Guys on here are picky and get too deep into this. No one who is super hot should get a 7. \n",

Idk why but this place is still often hard to get an honest consensus, you can be rated too low or too high, there’s people on this sub that objectively look worse than you and they get higher ratings. Quite a number of ppl here rate overweight people/people with significant face fat or anything that distinguishes you (eg u being non-binary perhaps) quite harshly, tbh Reddit’s version of beauty (by looking at the posts that got a lot of upvotes in this sub) is a skinny white chick with big eyes/circle contacts. So if you don’t fit that you may get some lower ratings than you deserve. But keep in mind everyone has different opinions, but they shouldn’t matter to you, because you look nice!!\n",

Firstly, lose the makeup and get on a good skincare routine, it doesn't look good, ages your face like shit currently, very ligjtmakeup or lose it dear. Next, I think a little weight loss will help, females generally look better carrying some bodyfat but with your facial structure its hindering you, lose 5-10ibs accordingly. Next trim and shape your eyebrows less aggressively. Keep a natural hair colour, less wavy but not completely flat and straight, volume is good. Also drop that mascara. Post body and no makeup pics for further assessment.\n",

That smile makes a difference.  Also, perpetual singledom is not exclusively due to how you look.  There's many other variables to that.  Do you approach guys or do you just wait for them to approach?  \n",
      "5/10 but you look super pretty in the smiling pics so while I hate to be cliche maybe relax your face and try smiling more. With a bit of makeup or clearing up your skin you could be a 7. Try tea tree oil for any current acne and rosehip/argan twice a day for any scars or blemishes. Definitely try shaping your brows a bit more, threading can help with that\n",

You have hooded eyes and they're small so you want light colors on the bottom so as not to make them appear smaller. You have pretty good skin and high cheekbones. Having your hair down (I assume it's not too short) will help frame your face and make it look thinner. Especially if you have layers hitting at chin level. \n",
      "As a recommendation: one thing I recently learned is to ensure when you have your picture taken, jut your chin out a bit and look up into the camera where possible. This creates a better shadow on your jawline and decreases emphasis on your neck / chin. In other words, reduces double chin. I have a tendency to pull my head back when I smile, so I end up with double chin. This fixes that.\n",
